# synthetic-population-ATUS

This repository contains the procedures to generate a synthetic population based on daily routine activities. This work contributes to generating parameters of an ABM model to assess policies against COVID-19 for Harris County in the US. The primary input is the results from the survey: IPUMS ATUS 2019. The methodology follows a series of estimations of probabilities to perform an activity on a given population profile and validation of results using MSE measures between the original and simulated population.
